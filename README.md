Form integration & testing
--------------------------

What changed
- The site contact forms on `index.html` and `contact/contact_us.html` were replaced with a Zoho Forms embed (public iframe). This centralises submissions to the configured Zoho account.
- A WhatsApp floating button was added to both pages to provide a quick alternate contact channel.

How to test locally
1. Open `index.html` and `contact/contact_us.html` in a browser (double-click the files or serve the directory with a simple static server).
2. Verify the Zoho form iframe loads. If the iframe is blocked by browser mixed-content policies, host the site over HTTPS or test the page from a deployed URL.
3. Submit a test entry through the form and confirm it appears in the Zoho Forms dashboard for the account that owns the form.
4. Click the WhatsApp floating button â€” it should open WhatsApp Desktop or mobile with a prefilled message to `+2349057240646`.

Smoke test checklist
- [ ] Zoho form loads on both pages
- [ ] Submission is accepted and recorded in Zoho
- [ ] WhatsApp button opens prefilled chat

Rollback
- To revert, restore the previous commit that contained the original forms or remove the iframe markup from the pages.
